    information: "MATOS Web compiles acoustic telemetry project information and helps users learn more about ongoing acoustic telemetry projects in the Mid Atlantic.  Scientists have been implanting Mid Atlantic fish with transmitters and, like the GPS on a car, have been tracking fish movement through a network of receivers placed on the bottom of the lakes.  The purpose of MATOS is to help scientists and the public learn more about Mid Atlantic acoustic telemetry projects and their contribution to research."
